Card Shuffling
--------------

Here are a few simple algorithms to shuffle a deck of cards. Shuffling is an interesting problem
where minor details can sometimes be overlooked.

Here are 3 simple solutions with their time complexities

1. SimpleShuffleRandom -- generates a random number and assigns the card - O(n)
2. KnuthShuffle -- swaps current card with a card from a random index - O(n)
3. SortingShuffle -- generates 52 random numbers between 0-1 and sorts them - O(nlogn)
